# Drum-Kit
A web dev project that produces drum sounds on the various pressing/clicking buttons on the webpage.

In this project, I utilised HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to develop a website that uses EventListeners to generate drum sounds. The sound is produced when the button is clicked or when the key is registered as an input from the keyboard by the user.
